The OECD Learning Compass 2030 is an evolving learning framework that sets out an aspirational vision for the future of education. 
It supports the wider goals of education and provides points of orientation towards the future we want: individual and collective well-being.
The framework offers a broad vision of what students will need to thrive in 2030 and beyond, e.g. student agency, student well-being, and the types of competencies (knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values). 
It is globally informed, to be locally contextualized.
The metaphor of a learning compass was adopted to emphasizes the need for students to learn to navigate by themselves through unfamiliar contexts, and find their direction in a meaningful and responsible way, instead of simply receiving fixed instructions or directions from their teachers.
