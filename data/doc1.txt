Directly underneath AI, we have machine learning, which involves creating models by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data.
It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.
There are many types of machine learning techniques or algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), clustering and more. 
Each of these approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data.
But one of the most popular types of machine learning algorithm is called a neural network (or artificial neural network). 
Neural networks are modeled after the human brain's structure and function. 
A neural network consists of interconnected layers of nodes (analogous to neurons) that work together to process and analyze complex data. 
Neural networks are well suited to tasks that involve identifying complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data.
