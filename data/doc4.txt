During the pre-digital era, patients suffered from inefficient and faulty clinical systems, processes, and conditions.
Many medical errors happened in the past due to undeveloped health technologies. 
Some examples of these medical errors included adverse drug events and alarm fatigue. 
When many alarms are repeatedly triggered or activated, especially for unimportant events, workers may become desensitized to the alarms. 
Healthcare professionals who have alarm fatigue may ignore an alarm believing it to be insignificant, which could lead to death and dangerous situations. 
With technological development, an intelligent program of integration and physiologic sense-making was developed and helped reduce the number of false alarms.
Also, with greater investment in health technologies, fewer medical errors happened.
Outdated paper records were replaced in many healthcare organizations by electronic health records . 
According to studies, this has brought many changes to healthcare.[5] Drug administration has improved, healthcare providers can now access medical information easier, provide better treatments and faster results, and save more costs.
